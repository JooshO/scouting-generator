# Scouting Question Generator

A desktop application designed to make the process of setting the questions on the scouting app easy and painless.

Currently supports:

- Drag and drop reordering and switching between sections
- Deleting questions added by mistake or with misspellings
- Number, Incrementing Number, Text, Single-select, and Checkbox question types
- Saving the output file as a json to be moved to the app

TODO:

- Ability to load json files for modification so you can work with what you alread created
- In-code documentation
- Add a logo!

Note: Match Number and Team Number do not need to be added to other areas, and should not be moved from their starting location

To build this code from source you will need to set up Tauri. The guide linked [here](https://tauri.app/v1/guides/getting-started/prerequisites) will instruct on how to set up dependencies. I use VSCode as my editor of choice with rust-analyzer and Svelte for VSCode extensions among others for personal preference.
