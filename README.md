# Scouting Question Generator

A desktop application designed to make the process of setting the questions on the scouting app easy and painless.

Currently supports:

- Drag and drop reordering and switching between sections
- Deleting questions added by mistake or with misspellings
- Number, Incrementing Number, Text, Single-select, and Checkbox question types
- Saving the output file as a json to be moved to the app

TODO:

- Pit scouting support (also needed on the app)
- Ability to load json files for modification so you can work with what you alread created
- In-code documentation
- Add a logo!

Note: Match Number and Team Number do not need to be added to other areas, and should not be moved from their starting location
